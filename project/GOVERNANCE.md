# MTL-XF-040 — Governance

This is a simulated confidential-client engagement using public/open data. Stakeholders and commercial/security scenarios are fictional. Do not claim real-client employment, endorsement, operational deployment or realised benefits. This master pack specifies work to be completed; it does not claim the team has executed it.

## Accountability and gates

Security Operations Centre Manager owns business scope, assumptions and action approval. Governance owns source/rights/freeze; Engineer owns transformations; SOC and Threat Intelligence Analyst owns interpretation; Security Model Assurance Analyst independently reviews. The simulated Mettelo panel owns programme acceptance. Record actual team members separately from simulated stakeholder roles.

| Gate | Due | Evidence and accountable reviewers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 scope/source | Week 2 | Security Operations Centre Manager, BA and Governance approve eight requirements, S1 rights/manifest, actual fields and frozen cohort. Unsupported mandatory outputs block dependent work. |
| G2 engineering/metrics | Week 4 | Engineer, SOC and Threat Intelligence Analyst and distinct reviewer approve row accounting, keys/joins, K1–K7, five reconciliations and evaluation manifest. |
| G3 policy | Week 6 | Security Operations Centre Manager reviews baseline/alternative, sensitivity, workload, assumptions and one insufficient-evidence/manual-review case. |
| G4 release | Week 8 | Simulated Mettelo panel and Security Model Assurance Analyst accept D1–D12, AC1–AC12, ten executed tests, three UAT tasks and clean rerun with zero critical/high defects. |

## Domain controls

Offline only: no DNS resolution, live URL visits, webpage fetching, exploit testing or credential collection. Existing extracted features may include source population statistics and webpage-only signals. Never present these as all available at initial URL receipt; no proof of current maliciousness.

**Primary risk:** Reversed labels, shared-domain leakage or live browsing of dataset URLs would invalidate or compromise triage.

Baseline simple lexical rule IsDomainIP=1 or URLLength>100 (project rule); compare validation-selected lexical model with review thresholds. Choose high-risk threshold maximising phishing recall subject to validation legitimate FPR≤1%; if infeasible mark target unmet. Add intermediate review band at score≥0.50 and below high threshold (if high threshold<0.50 choose and document lower review boundary on validation). Never auto-open or automatically block URLs.

All capacity, threshold, financial and review/remediation targets are project assumptions unless explicitly attributed. Human deferrals/overrides record reason, evidence, owner and next review. No production action is authorised by this pack.

## Source and evaluation control

All 235,795 original records; retain source IDs for lineage and quarantine duplicate/conflicting-label groups. Original label=1 is legitimate and label=0 phishing; create explicit phishing_event=1−label for evaluation.

Follow [S1 register](../data/SOURCE_REGISTER.md); preserve original bytes outside Git, immutable snapshot, manifest and reviewer access. Checksum mismatch stops processing until investigated. Never silently replace a variant/feed. No raw data uploaded by this update.

Group-based approximately 60/20/20 train/validation/test by registrable domain using seed 40; missing/unparseable domains stay in a quarantine table. Keep duplicate normalised URLs in one group. Fit all learned preprocessing on train. Exclude URL, Domain, FILENAME and label identifiers; core lexical-only model excludes webpage-derived and unverifiable corpus-derived features, including URLSimilarityIndex/TLDLegitimateProb/URLCharProb unless train-only derivation can be reproduced. A full provided-feature offline model may be reported separately with provenance caveats.

Lock target mapping, predictors, timing and policy configuration before test evaluation. Descriptive projects retain resample/sensitivity evidence. Record unsupported metrics and negative findings.

## Change and exception control

Record change ID, requester/date/reason, original/revised source/cohort/requirement, rights/field evidence, affected K/D/AC/DT, time/risk impact, owner, reviewer and decision. New inputs get new freeze IDs and affected checks rerun. Missing mandatory support blocks dependent work.

Each operational exception needs case, rationale, evidence, accountable owner, approval, compensating/manual control, expiry and next review; expired exceptions return to review.

Security work is offline public-data analysis and explicitly synthetic scenarios. No system scanning, exploitation, live suspicious-URL visits or credential collection. Preserve defanged/hashes-only published evidence.

## Publication and release

Keep attribution, snapshot and limitations in every portfolio/dashboard/slide export. No secrets or private correspondence. Release after all AC/DT/UAT and rerun evidence passes with zero critical/high defects. Record final commit/tag and rollback to approved snapshot/configuration.
